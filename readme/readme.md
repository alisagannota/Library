# Goals

1. I want to have the "type=range" sliders correspond with audio files to adjust the volume of them individually. I created the sliders themsleves and formatted them. Now, I am trying to figure out what is the best way to code that interaction. I started to experiment with JS to see if that would work but I still haven't been able to figure that out. 
*(Update: I think I kind of figured it out, will ahve to test properly later)*
*(Update 2: only works on my computer :( )*

2. After that, I'll have to see if the layering of sounds works.

3. Adjust the mute/unmute buttons to turn off all of the audios at once.

# Idea Description

*Orginal Sketches for my idea but I also kind of redesigining it as I go.*

The idea is to create an audio site that can recreate the disturbing sounds in the library that we are now unable to visit because of COVID. You would be able to adjust each sound individually to create your own atmosphere.
